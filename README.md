# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System 

we will explore and implement a collaborative filtering recommendation system. Collaborative filtering is a popular recommendation technique that relies on user-item interaction data to make personalized recommendations.

# Introduction 

What is Collaborative Filtering?

    Collaborative filtering is a recommendation technique that makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaboration).       It assumes that users who have agreed in the past tend to agree again in the future.

How Does it Work?

    Collaborative filtering works in the following way:

      User-Item Interaction Data: Collect data on how users interact with items (e.g., ratings, purchase history).

      User Similarity or Item Similarity: Calculate the similarity between users or items based on their interaction patterns. Common similarity metrics include cosine similarity and Pearson correlation.

      Recommendation: To make recommendations, identify users or items that are similar to the target user or item. Recommend items that similar users have liked (user-based) or recommend items that are similar to                         items the user has liked (item-based).
